  <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Michael Brothers, I am 28 Years old and currently live in Tarves, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.<br>
    I have an extremely strong sales background in my profesional life, having worked in and around multiple jobs linked to this industry. I started off originally working in my family business as a delivery boy and worked through the business to
    becoem a sales manager. I left this role to pursue a career in rugby however once this was made clear it was not a viable long term option, I went back to what I know and took up a Currency Broker role at The Foremost Currency Group.
    Unfortunatly
    due to a company restructure the whole team that I was working with were made redundant which was highly frustrating as I had taken a lot of time to build up my own clientel and was becoming reasonanably succesful. After this I decided to try
    and
    create my own clothing brand. This was a hugely enlightening experience and taught me alot about multiple facets of business from production, design to sales and marketing. However just as I was about to launch the brand, the Covid pandemic
    took
    over so i had to put that on hold. My family then decided to move up to Scotland which I have helped with due to my parents age and Mothers ill health. Having since moved to Scotland I have decided to revist a passion I had during my time at
    school, Web Development. I was always interested in the computer technology classes we had and have seen lockdown as the perfect opportunity to try and learn to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I have been undertaking courses on Udemy
    specifically their "Complete 2022 Web Development Course". I am looking for a junior web developer position in order to train my skills further and then progress onto a full stack web developer.
